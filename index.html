        <h3>Part 1: Telling Data Stories</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><span>Q1</span> What is the Oxford English Dictionary's definition of a narrative?</dt>
            <dd>
                The Oxford English Dictionary's definition of narrative is: "an account of a series of events, facts
                , etc., given in order and with the establishing of connections between them."
                This definition can also be applied to narrative visualization. Data is presented using different
                genres of visualization where transitions, such as consistent labels between plots or animated
                transitions, is used to connect the story.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl class="mt-5">
            <dt><span>Q2</span> What is your favorite visualization among the examples in section 3? Explain why in a few words</dt>
            <dd>
                The "Gapminder Human Development Trends" is the most compelling visualisation to us. It contains a lot
                of graphical features, but they are introduced one at a time and are thus not overwhelming the reader.
                The author also provides annotations for each section to help the reader to understand the underlying narrative.
                Even though three different plots are used, the reader can easily identify the similar elements used
                , since animated transitions are used to morph the chart types.
                Furthermore two progress bars helps the reader to navigate and keep track of the story.
                Its martini glass structure is a nice balance between an author driven and a user driven narrative
                , that also lets the reader explore the data themselves independent from the authors narrative.

            <dt><span>Q3</span> What's the point of Figure 7?</dt>
            <dd>
                The point of figure 7 is to give an overview of specific design strategies used in 58 visualization.
                The statespace is used to show:
                <ul>
                    <li>Genre types for narrative visualizations</li>
                    <li>Methods of integrating visualizations with accompanying text</li>
                    <li>Unique patterns for narrative visualization</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl class="mt-5">
            <dt>
                <span>Q4</span>
                Use Figure 7 to find the most common design choice within each category for the Visual narrative and
                Narrative structure (the categories within visual narrative
                are 'visual structuring', 'highlighting', etc)
            </dt>
            <dd>
                The most common design choices are listed with the following format: category
                , design choice, # of occurrences.
                <ul class="no-bullets">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Visual structuring:</strong> Consistent Visual Platform, 34 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Highlighting:</strong> Feature Distinction, 46
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Transition guidance:</strong> Object Continuity, 22 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul class="no-bullets">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ordering:</strong> User Directed Path, 30
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Interactivity:</strong> Filtering / Selection / Search 38 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Messaging:</strong> Captions / Headlines 49
                    </li>
                </ul>
                All of these elements is in general very effective when using visualization to tell a story.
                The key word here is general as the choice of visual structuring
                , highlighting etc. is highly depending on the story that needs to be told.

                    <dd>
                        It depends a lot on the complexity of the story but in general our favorite genres are Film / Video / Animation that contains audio as messaging.&nbsp;
                        A lot of information can be obtained by both viewing something visual as well as listening to some audio.&nbsp;
                        The narrative stories in videos are mostly author-driven with limited interactivity,&nbsp;
                        but it is often possible to rewind / fast forward if the audience gets lost in the story.

                    <dd>
                        This does again depends on the story. It is probably the comic strip,&nbsp;
                        as it is the most unconventional and difficult to use for more than conveying a simple point.&nbsp;
                        Comic strips are not very efficient in professional / serious environments.&nbsp;
                        Furthermore it's hard to create small comic strips that contain a lot of information.

            <h3>Part 2: Visualizing Murders over Time</h3>
            <p>
                This visualisation of murders over time in NYC consists of a
                timeline that displays the number of murders per day from 2006 to 2016,
                a map displaying their locations, and a bar chart displaying their hourly distribution.
                The timeline, map and bar chart are each brushable to enable filtering of the murders and are all
                cross-filtered using
                &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/crossfilter/crossfilter" target="_blank">crossfilter.js</a>
                &nbsp;for the ultimate cross-filter experience. Press the play button to start a little animation
                of the murder development through time. Alternatively look at the
                <a href="minimum.html" target="_blank">minimum implementation</a> that doesn't rely on
                <a href="https://github.com/crossfilter/crossfilter" target="_blank">crossfilter.js</a>
                and also includes all days without reported murders into the timeline.
